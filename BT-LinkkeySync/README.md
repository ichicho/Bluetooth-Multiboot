2. Open the Terminal and navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the file`BT-Linkkeysync.py`
2. Mark the script as executable with `sudo chmod +x BT-Linkkeysync.py`
3. Run the script with `sudo ./BT-Linkkeysync.py`(you will be asked for your password)
4. Store the generated file `btkeys.reg` file to a location accessible by windows.
5. Download [psexec]
   and store it to `C:/Windows/System32/`
6. Run the command:
   `psexec -s -i regedit`
7. Import the file `btkeys.reg`(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
8. No need to reboot
